# ProjComputacaoDistribuida_Backend

This is the Backend portion of my Distributed Computing final Project.

It requires an Apache Directory Server and a CouchDB Server. It will authenticate users using the LDAP protocol, and store stuff in the DB using HTTP.

It contains a Java RMI Server, as it is how the Frontend communicates with it
